Recursion: Shift Left by Addition

Explanation:
The shift left operation is similar to multiplication by powers of two.
This can also be achieved with repetitive addition, thus, the process can be done recursively.
Create a recursive function that mimics the shift left operator
and returns the result from the two given integers.

Notes
There will be no negative values for the second parameter y.
You're expected to solve this challenge using a recursive approach.
