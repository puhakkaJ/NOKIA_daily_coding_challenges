Pandigital products

Explanation:
n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once
; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

CHANGES: Testing is_pandigital() function with inputs from test.py and checking if it works right with help of the find_pandigital_products()
+++ intentionally leaving the duplicant multiplication results in the pandigitals return list due testing.
