3n + 1 Problem (Collatz Conjecture)

A Collatz sequence is generated by repeatedly applying the following rules to an integer and then to each resulting integer in turn:

If even: divide by 2.
If odd: multiply by 3, then add 1.
The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all positive integers.

Create a function that, when given two positive integers a b, returns the string "a" if integer a took fewer steps to reach 1 than b when passed through the Collatz sequence, or "b" if integer b took fewer steps to reach 1 than a.

Assume a and b never take the same number of steps to reach 1.
